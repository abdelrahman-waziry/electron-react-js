# Electron ReactJS Starter Kit
If you are like me and likes ReactJS, you'll love this kit. This is kit is created to help Electron JS developers to bootstrap their projects with the CRA (Create React App). Create your next cross-platform application using React Components.

## Installation

 1. Clone this project: `git clone https://github.com/imdhemy/electron-react-js.git {dir-name}`
 2. Install the node modules 
 `yarn install` or `npm install`
 3. Run the development environment:
  `yarn electron-dev` or `npm run electron-dev`
 4. Edit `src/App.js` file and save to reload.

## Build

 - **To Pack your app**, run `yarn electron-pack` or `npm run electron-pack`
 - **To Build a distribution version**, `run yarn electron-dist` or `npm run electron-dist`

## TODO

 - [ ] Open dev tools only on development.
 - [ ] Run nodeJS server on startup to run as a backend server.
 - [ ] Support a persistent Data Base.
 - [ ] Enhance the README file.
